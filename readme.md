# Personal_site
## Intro

I basically have two personal sites on the web but I feel that I want to start
consolidating them into one main site. That's the purpose of this project - I also
want the personal sites built with PHP instead of a simple web page. This project
I'll be building over the course of a few weeks most likely.
