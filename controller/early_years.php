        My first experience with programing, where I was drawn in, may have been
        playing Super Mario Bros, on the NES, when I was in first grade. As I moved
        Mario slowly across the screen in world 1-1, my mind was transported to
        a digital realm. I wanted to understand how that digital realm functioned.
        How did the code let me jump only so high? Why could I not move the screen
        to the left? How could blocks appear to float in the sky in defiance of
        gravity. At one point during elementary school, in the early 90's, I remember
        thinking that I wanted to be a video game programmer. I wanted to make
        those virtual worlds. It would be years though before I'd ever start
        programming. That did not happen until high school. It was not a class that
        I took. I just wanted to learn - the language that I choose...well I don't
        remember. I want to say it was Basic but I just have no idea. My brother
        had a friend who was a programmer and he may have told me to choose it. I
        had a book that guided you how to learn the language and I spent many Friday
        nights slowly learning the language. I focused on making this choose your
        own adventure game - at one point the screen turned red if you choose a
        specific option. Not the coolest. However, I remember I let my little
        brother try the game out. He and I always fought and I think he thought
        the game was dumb at first. As he started to play it and saw that the screen
        would change color based on his actions I think he bacame a little
        impressed. For me, I had a basic version of that digital world that I so
        wanted to learn how to do back in First Grade...
