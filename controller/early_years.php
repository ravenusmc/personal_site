        My first experience with programing, where I was drawn in, may have been
        playing Super Mario Bros, on the NES, when I was in first grade. As I moved
        Mario slowly across the screen in world 1-1, my mind was transported to
        a digital realm. I wanted to understand how that digital realm functioned.
        How did the code let me jump only so high? Why could I not move the screen
        to the left? How could blocks appear to float in the sky in defiance of
        gravity. At one point during elementary school, in the early 90's, I remember
        thinking that I wanted to be a video game programmer. I wanted to make
        those virtual worlds. It would be years though before I'd ever start
        programming. That did not happen until high school. It was not a class that
        I took. I just wanted to learn - the language that I choose...well I don't
        remember. I want to say it was Basic but I just have no idea. My brother
        had a friend who was a programmer and he may have told me to choose it. I
        had a book that guided you how to learn the language and I spent many Friday
        nights slowly learning the language. I focused on making this choose your
        own adventure game - at one point the screen turned red if you choose a
        specific option. Not the coolest. However, I remember I let my little
        brother try the game out. He and I always fought and I think he thought
        the game was dumb at first. As he started to play it and saw that the screen
        would change color based on his actions I think he bacame a little
        impressed. For me, I had a basic version of that digital world that I so
        wanted to learn how to do back in First Grade...

        Towards the end of my Freshman year in high school I started a project
        that was supposed to be for my science honors class. This project was
        to record the weather every day - at both the morning and the night.
        At the end of the project I would graph all the data out and present it.
        I did all that but when my Freshman year was over I continued to collect
        data all summer. I continued to collect it, almost every day, until around
        late winter/early spring of my Senior year. I then entered all my data into
        excel, made graphs from the data but also used some sine/cosine functions
        to build a basic model of the data. This model would give me a general idea
        of what the temperature would be like over on any particular day. This was
        really my first journey in collecting / examing a "fairly" large amount of
        data. I found that I loved looking at it and learrning about the weather.
        I loved how the graphs could show there wave like structure - in the summer
        the wave would be high and then in the fall it would drop down. If
        I zoomed in on that wave, you'd see that the temperature would fluctuate
        from day to day. It was not until years later, when I was in Iraq, that
        I started to really get interested in looking at data again.

        One day, in the late fall / early winter of 2013 I came home from work
        and was bored. I was playing around on my computer and decided that I'd
        watch a Khan Academy video on a particular history topic. This was something
        that I did from time to time - I love history - I am a history major! But
        on this particular day, something drew me to the computer science section
        the site. I clicked on one video, that was on Python, and started to watch it.
        I told myself that I can do that - I had in High School. So, I installed
        Python and started to code along following the video. This was the start of
        the reawakening. Slowly, over the following few months, I'd get books on
        Python and started to code. I barely made any progress though. I wanted to
        build something - but wasn't sure what. It would still be another 18 months
        before the sun started to rise and I'd start to make a life long dream
        come true...

        In the spring of 2015 I realized that if I wanted to actually get into
        coding I would need something to help push me. I decided to attend the
        coding boot camp Tech Talent South and went through their programming. There
        I learned HTML, CSS, Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I learned enough to really start
        motivating myself to get serious about programming. In the Fall of 2015 I
        attended a 3 month long "internship" at a place called LAMP Camp. Here
        I focused on PHP and met a lot of good people.
